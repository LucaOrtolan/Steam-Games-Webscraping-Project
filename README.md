# Steam-Games-Webscraping-Project

The project consists to extract all relevant data from the 5000 most played Steam games, such as the number of active players, price, genre and reviews. All the data was scraped from the websites https://steamcharts.com/top and https://store.steampowered.com.

The pynb file contains the code used for the webscrape. Check the excel file for the final result.

N.B. The prices of some games in the excel file are expressed in Taiwanese dollars. The reason for that is because the store pages for these games aren't accessible from the European region and thus their prices aren't in euros.
